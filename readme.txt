Image to ASCII Converter
This is a small project that converts images to ASCII using Flask and the PIL library.

Description
The Image to ASCII converter is a web application that allows you to upload images and convert them into ASCII representations. The process involves resizing the image, converting it to grayscale, and mapping the brightness values of the pixels to predefined ASCII characters.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed before running the application:

Python 3
Flask
PIL (Pillow)
Usage
Clone the repository or download the files to your machine.

Install the aforementioned dependencies.

Run the application using the following command:
python app.py
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

On the home page, you can either select an image file from your device or provide an image URL.

Specify the desired size for the ASCII image and click the "Convert" button.

The converted image will be displayed on the same page.
